MUST USE SERIAL TERMINAL to start program.  It waits forever
for you to connect.

  The program, seesaw_pwm_freq_cc.ino, shows that the way the
Adafruit Arduino library talks to the Seesaw Breakout is via
a simplified i2c interface.

In this revision, focus is placed on the duty cycle, to get
the servo motor to do something interesting.

The previous program, seesaw_pwm_freq_bb.ino, did not do this.
It was not directly interesting to moving a servo motor's arm.

This program corrects that deficit.
